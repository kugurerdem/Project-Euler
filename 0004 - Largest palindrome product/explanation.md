# Solution A

We can easily check all the products of pair 3-digit numbers, and memorise the largest palindrome by comparing the palindromes we get earlier with the palindromes we get later.


# Solution B

In the second solution we can create palindromes from large numbers to low numbers and try to factorisize them, if both of the factors of the palindrome are 3-digits, then we have find our palindrome.
