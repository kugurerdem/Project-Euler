# What is Project-Euler

Project Euler is a project that merges programming with mathematics. What Project Euler does is actually asking questions that you need to use mathematics and programming to solve them. There are lots of questions and with each question you solved, it gets harder. With that you can imrpove your analytical thinking and problem solving skills, you also learn new Math concepts and use them a lot.

# Which language is used in this repository

Actually there is no limitations, i will share the solutions without looking to the programming language. So some questions might be answered in more than one language.
